# 9. Working with Azure PowerShell

We can simulate each test case by unit test and then run against Azure.

1. Write unit test for simple example
1. Write new test context for test a throwing the exception if virtual machine does not exist and implement this case
1. Write new test context for testing a script block for status checking of virtual machine
